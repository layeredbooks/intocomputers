# GHDL

## Ubuntu

We can install [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) in Ubuntu, as a package, by doing

    sudo apt install ghdl

## Mac

We can install GHDL on Mac, by using a
[prebuilt](ghdl_mac_prebuilt.md) version of GHDL.

As an alternative, you might want to build GHDL
[from source](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/development/building/index.html).
