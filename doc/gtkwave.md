# GTKWave

## Ubuntu

A GTKWave version for Ubuntu can be installed in Ubuntu, by giving the command

~~~
sudo apt-get install gtkwave
~~~

The program can then be started by giving the command gtkwave.

## Mac

We can download a
[GTKWave version for Mac](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/gtkwave.zip),
in the form of a zip-file that 
contains an app folder with an executable GTKWave program.

The GTKWave program can be
started from the GUI via Mac-right-clicking on the app folder (the app icon) of the program and
selecting Open - to indicate that you are sure that you want to open it.

It can also be started from a Terminal, by giving a command indicating the name of the executable gtkwave program.

Having installed gtkwave in the folder (you can copy either the zip file or the unzipped content to the folder)

~~~
$HOME/sw/gtkwave
~~~

I could start the program by doing

~~~
$HOME/sw/gtkwave/gtkwave.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gtkwave
~~~
